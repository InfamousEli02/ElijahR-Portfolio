      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I'm Elijah Reed. I'm 23 years old and I live in New Jersey.<br />
        My prior knowledge of computer science and web development comes from my time in High School<br />
        and The Knowledge House/Foundations Fellowship.<br />
        Through my portfolio, I hope to demonstrate this knowledge and all that I have learned<br />
        in my journey. I'm open to feedback and want to continue learning from others so<br />
        I can do the absolute best that I can.<br />
        One of my goals is to constantly improve on my communication skills so I can better<br />
        communicate with my peers and properly take initiative when in group environments.</p>
      <br />
      <p>In my free time, I enjoy playing video games, watching anime, writing and drawing.<br />
        I would like to practice digital drawing!</p>
